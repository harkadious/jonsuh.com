      <h2>Will work for food?</h2>
      <p>I’ve followed and admired Brian Hoff for years&mdash;when I had this chance to work with him, I was beyond thrilled. I worked with Brian to announce <em>TwoPlease</em>, a side project that he and his wife, Kathleen, had been working together on.</p>
      <p>He was in need of a landing page for TwoPlease that would describe the purpose and intentions behind it as well as communicate his desire to find back-end and iOS engineers interested in joining him and Kathleen on this venture.</p>
      <p>Nearly complete with the design, Brian reached out to see if I was available to help him build out this page.</p>
