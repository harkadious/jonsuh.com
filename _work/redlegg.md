      <h2>Making one’s vision a reality</h2>
      <p>RedLegg had a vision to redesign their website so they’d stand out from their competitors—they approached Juice Interactive, and we were thrilled to partner with RedLegg to help make their vision a reality. Once the designs were complete, I got to handle the front-end development—I had a lot of fun bringing the designs to life, especially the fun, interactive parts of the site.</p>

      <h2>SVG &amp; CSS Animations</h2>
      <p>We stretched the limits of modern browsers by converting the illustrations to inline SVG, allowing them to scale nicely regardless of screen size or pixel density, and brought the illustrations to life by animating them with CSS transitions and keyframe animations. We used GIFs as fallbacks for browsers that don’t support SVGs and CSS animations.</p>
